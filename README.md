# Code Challenge

**Lytt**, the first digital assistant that makes it easy for employees to communicate sensitive topics at work and is currently working in a new assistant functionality: recognize a message language and reply with the correct Bot message. Lytt is asking you _to develop this new REST API._



## 1. Guidelines

-   **Detect** German, English and Spanish language only
-   **Receive** a text message from a reporting person (user) in any language
-   **Reply** with the correct Salutation on every user input, in the correct user session

As this challenge is based on the concept of real-time conversations (chat bots), you are encouraged to use a front-end implementation to demonstrate this functionality.

You are free to explore different solutions and any framework, _but you should document and justify your technology choices._

## 2. Receive a user message

A user will join a Chat Session and can send any message into that session. User messages will always go through this process and messages should have an unique, randomly generated ID. 

The session is used to keep track of how many messages were sent between a user and the bot and if a refresh occurs, still display past messages_ from that session._

**Request**

    POST "/sessions/{session-id}/messages"

    {

        "text": "{user-text-input}",

        "identifier": "{unique-generated-id}"

    }

**Response (success)**

```json5
    // Supported language

    {

      "message": {
        "identifier": "{unique-generated-id}",
        "detected_language": "es",
        "timestamp": "2020-08-01T18:20:00Z"
      }
    }
```

**Response (error)**

```json5
    // Language is not supported

    {
     "error": {
       "message": "Unfortunately we don't have support for your language yet."
      }
    }
```
_a) Response Status should be 201 for success_

_b) Response Status should be __422__ for error_




## 3. Fetch a message 

This endpoint returns the information about a message sent into the session. It can be used to retrieve information about a previous message.

**Request**

    GET "/sessions/{session-id}/messages/{identifier-id}"

**Response (success)**

    {

        "message": {

            "identifier": "{identifier-id}",

            "detected_language": "es",

            "timestamp": "2020-08-01T18:20:00Z"

        }

    }

**Response (error)**

    // Message ID doesn't exist for this session

    Status 404

_a) Response status should be 200 for success_

_b) Response status should be 404 for error_

_c) Content-Type should be JSON_




## 4. Reply with Bot Message

The first message sent into the session defines the language that is going to be used in the entirety of the conversation between the user and the bot.

This endpoint provides all replies from the bot in the detected language for this session. 

_After the first message, you should not display the salutation again_.

**Request**

    GET "/sessions/{session-id}/replies"

**Response**

    {

      "replies": [

        {

          "message": "Hallo! Ich bin ein virtueller Assistent und ich bin hier, um zu helfen. Was m√∂chtest du tun?",

          "shortname": "de.salutation",

          "reply_to": "{first-message-identifier}"

         },

         {

           "message": "In Zukunft werde ich in der Lage sein, jede deiner Fragen zu beantworten",

           "shortname": "de.after_salutation",

           "reply_to": "{second-message-identifier}" 

         } 

      ]

    }

_**Hint:**_ You can find language detection libraries for almost any programming language online_

## 5. Optional Extras

We would love to see an implementation that contains one or more of the items below, but they are optional:

-   Project uses `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`  
-   Chat between user and bot uses Web Sockets
-   Front-end can be used to send messages
-   Front-end test framework was used
-   Project demonstrates scalability
-   Thoroughly testing coverage



## 6. What we are looking for

For this challenge, we are looking at how you document, test and develop features given the guidelines provided using clean code. We want to see if you are familiar with the concepts of APIs, REST and HTTP. 

## 7. How to deliver this challenge

Please deliver the solution using a public repository on GitHub. Your repository should contain full instructions and documentation for us to run and test the project.

Hosting the solution on a cloud provider (Heroku, AWS, now.sh) is a great plus!


## 8. How we are evaluating

**a. Code Quality**

Is the code clean and understandable? Is the codebase organized in any existing pattern?

**b. Testing**

Is the project properly tested and covering edge cases? If tests are missing, what's the reasoning behind it?

**c. Validation**

Is the API properly validated? Does it validate the data sent to the server?

**d. Technology**

Does the technology options make sense for this project? 

**e. Documentation**

Is the project properly documented with instructions and justifications of the technological choices?
